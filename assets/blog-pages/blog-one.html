                Hi there, thanks for stopping by.
            </p>



            <!-- <h3 class="list-title">something goes here</h3> -->
            <!-- <ul class="general-list">
                <li>lorem</li>

                <li>lorem</li>
            </ul> -->

            <p class="text-one">I wanted to let you into a little secret… I have no idea what I’m
                doing, but who does? This includes how to write a blog or how to build a website. Actually, that last
                one's a
                lie. I built this one. However, there are a couple of points I’d like to make. </p>
            <p class="text-two">Numero Uno, and the main reason for this site is to learn in public. There’s a great
                YouTube discussion <a class="blog-links" target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yKfI4gP9Pg">here.</a> I
                listened to a
                while back, which encapsulates exactly what I want to achieve
                whilst learning Web Development. Paul and Mark talk through the benefits and how “Learning in public” is
                not always that. We often see a polished completed version of “how I already accomplished this (thing)”
                leaving out the blood, sweat and tears it took to get there. I’m giving you all of it, The good, the
                bad, and the ugly. </p>
            <p class="text-three"></p>
            <p class="text-three">In an article by <a class="blog-links" target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.swyx.io/">swyx</a> about why we
                should share our learning process, he said, “Make
                the thing you wish you had found when you were learning". You can read the article <a class="blog-links"
                    target="_blank" href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public">here.</a></p>
            <p class="text-five">What do I want to find?</p>
            <p class="text-six">I would love to find someone learning web development that actually talks about the
                challenging times. Or a senior Web developer when they first started out. I’d like to know the hours it
                took them to realize the problem was a missing closing tag or a typo. Seeing them look as confused as I
                do when trying to decipher MDN docs, or the dreaded git errors. I want to know that I’m not alone in my
                mistakes, frustrations and achievements.</p>
            <p class="text-seven">Therefore, I want to share as much of my learning journey as I can. So basically I’m
                making a fool of myself on the internet to make you feel better about yourself.</p>
            <p class="text-eight">Numero dos, I’m a perfectionist and very indecisive about building websites,
                especially this one. The third build is almost done, but I no longer like it. I want to change
                everything again. Moreover, I have no design abilities whatsoever. If I made my design decisions, this
                site would look like a 5-year-old built it.</p>
            <p class="text-nine">Given all the above, the site will change at some point, there are things still to be
                added, like a comment system. If you find a section that looks familiar please don’t sue me. I’m
                working on it.</p>
            <p class="text-ten">Feel free to provide constructive criticism via email my below.</p>
            <p class="text-ten">Thanks for visiting, it’s been nice. I hope you pop by again soon.</p>
